## Project Features

Visitors to the React Resort Hotel website are greeted with a colorful splash screen and styled hero that links to the assortment of hotel rooms available. Below that on the home page, a section of featured rooms is presented. Navigate to the Rooms page and you will find a search component where items can be sorted by a variety of features, including a pull-down for room type, slider bar for room price and inputs for min and max room size. Each selected room is shown on a single room page that displays all data for the specific hotel room, including info and images.

## Technologies

This project uses React coupled with the Styled Components package and plain CSS for front-end. The data for each room is stored on the Contentful headless CMS platform. Selected data is passed through a provider component that uses the create context hook for state management.

## Future Development

At this time there are no plans to develop this project future.
